## Best practices for maintaining a strong community
- <b>Keep it tidy.</b> Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:

    - Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.

    - Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.

    - Don’t post no-content replies.

    - Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.

    - Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.

    Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.

- Be clear and stay on topic. The Arc XP Developer Community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping other community members. Off-topic comments are a distraction from maintaining a strong community. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.

- Making suggestions. Topics should focus on collaboration, sharing ideas, and assisting fellow community members with development and technical solutions. While we always welcome suggestions to improve the Arc XP developer experience, product feature requests for authors, page editors, and site administrators should be submitted through [Feature Improvements & Ideas for Arc XP](https://ideas.arcxp.com/).
